Read Writing with That Tone</h2>\n<p>To write elegantly, you must first absorb elegance.</p>\n<h3>✍️ Writers to Explore:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paul Graham</strong> – Essays on thinking and life</li>\n<li><strong>Ali Abdaal</strong> – Blogs and newsletter</li>\n<li><strong>Austin Kleon</strong> – “Show Your Work”</li>\n<li><strong>Oliver Burkeman</strong> – “Four Thousand Weeks”</li>\n<li><strong>Naval Ravikant</strong> – Short‑form wisdom (tweets, podcast quotes)</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Practice:</em> Every day or two, read a short piece by any of these authors. Pay attention not just to <em>what</em> they say, but <em>how</em> they say it — rhythm, vocabulary, restraint, and structure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<!-- Section 2 -->\n<h2>✍️ 2. Freewrite in a Journal Daily (Short but Honest)</h2>\n<p>Write a short reflection at the end of the day — just one paragraph is enough.</p>\n<h3>💡 Prompt Ideas:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>“What did I pretend not to notice today?”</li>\n<li>“Where did I cut corners, and why?”</li>\n<li>“What’s something small that deserves applause today?”</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This habit builds clarity, self‑awareness, and your authentic voice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<!-- Section 3 -->\n<h2>🧱 3. Rewrite Casual Thoughts with Elevated Language</h2>\n<p>Take a simple thought and rewrite it like you're crafting a thoughtful blog or memoir entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Plain</em>: “I just kept submitting the same solution for the last week.”</li>\n<li><em>Elevated</em>: “For the past week, it wasn’t progress I chased — just the illusion of it. The same stale solution, submitted like a daily ritual, kept the flame alive.”</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do this regularly. It trains narrative instinct and word economy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<!-- Section 4 -->\n<h2>🧰 4. Keep a ‘Tone Toolkit’</h2>\n<p>Maintain a personal Notion, Obsidian, or text file where you collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phrases or metaphors you like</li>\n<li>Elegant sentence openers</li>\n<li>Quotes that match the vibe you’re aiming for</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is your go‑to vault whenever your writing feels flat or rushed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<!-- Section 5 -->\n<h2>🕰️ 5. Let It Happen Gradually</h2>\n<p>The goal is not to sound “smart” — it’s to sound <strong>authentically you</strong>, just with more grace and clarity.</p>\n<h3>🔁 Review Habit:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Revisit old reflections or notes weekly.</li>\n<li>Ask: “How would I say this now?”</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />"

I was really interested to take up that course and continue my SAP journey but yet again, this is SRM we are talking about, the deadline for the course was 10AM and they already closed the form by 9:28.

Later someone called me, I won't say the name but for reference, it was from <i> RA2311003030193. </i>Ahem Ahem! So, the person on the other side of the phone told me that the course form has been opened again and you have to 35k or so to avail the course. I was shoched! simply shocked but deep inside I also had an intuition that on surplus request, they might have opened the form again. Yeah, and the person also said that we have got a mail and mentor replied to my query about the course. I was so into the thing to get the course that I checked my mail twice and found nothing. Later I realised that the person was thinking that message shared by the mentor is a reply to my message whereas it was just a message that the mentor had to share in the group.

This is cool as this gets most of the things done really well. Now I need someway to make this acessible to everyone.<br> Before that, i think I can start with coding the scraper part first to get the info of the searhc result. I also need to think of all the edge cases and all the possible cases that you can search for in this app. that's gonna cost a lot of thinking... Anyways, I'll get back to it after dinner"},{"timestamp": "2025-08-03 22:50:44", "entry": "Don't know but was watching SpyxFamily after dinner. <br>Anyways, on a break now so will be getting back to the project thingy. The search query string of google contact is really simple actually, I can easily modify it as for my google account series. I'll need to look how do I make it compoletely dynamic. I'll think about that later.<br>For now, I can search for any name, mailID or registration number. i just need to extract that result somehow and get it into the python so that I can play with it."},{"timestamp": "2025-08-03 23:04:23", "entry": "That's weird... Google contacts use two layers to show the results and both of them show the same thing. Why use two same things that too ontop of each other when it can be done by only one thing? Guess that's a typical google thing. What I can think of is, one is used to add the UI part and other to add the functionality. <br> Anyways, I've got the divs that I wanna target, let's get the actually triggering them and moving ahead."}]
